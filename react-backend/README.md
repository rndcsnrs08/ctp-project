## <strong>summary</strong>

Create an interactive web application that allows users to find publicly accessible data in their area or a given location. The process can be explained as a user will enter a range to cover and our web app will show the data such as events, crime, housing, etc based on preferences. Data can be received from calls to APIâ€™s or a dedicated backend storage.
